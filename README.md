### PS4 - problem 2
 
 SMC estimation for the stylized state-space model in *Herbst and Schorfheide (2015)* can be found in the folder ''Identification Problems". It contains two experiments: 
- **Global identification problem**: it highlights the bimodality of the posterior distribution. 
- **Local identification problem**: it highlights the weak identification. 

Furthermore, the SMC is also used for Bayesian inference of the parameters of the small-scale New Keynesian model presented in section 1.1 of *Herbst and Schorfheide (2015)*.
